# COVID-19-Research-articles-Clustering
Kaggle's project with COVID-19

Given a large amount of literature and rapidly spreading COVID-19, it is difficult for a scientist to keep up with the research community promptly. Can we cluster similar research articles together to make it easier for health professionals to find relevant research articles? Clustering can be used to create a tool to identify similar articles, given a target article. It can also reduce the number of articles one has to go through as one can focus on a cluster of articles rather than all.

This competition will give some help for those who research some insights with those articles. It will reduce the time to find a related article, hence enhanced the time to actually research.
